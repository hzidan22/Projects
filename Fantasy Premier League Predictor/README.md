## 📊 Output Files

The system generates several output files:

- **`selected_team.csv`** - Your optimal 15-player squad
- **`starting_xi.csv`** - Recommended starting lineup
- **`team_report.txt`** - Comprehensive team analysis
- **`player_predictions.csv`** - All player point predictions
- **`model_performance_report.csv`** - Model comparison results
- **`model_feature_importance.csv`** - Feature importance rankings

## 🎯 Captain Selection Algorithm

The captain selection uses a sophisticated scoring system:

```python
Captain Score = (
    Predicted Points × 0.5 +
    Form Score × 0.2 +
    Consistency × 0.15 +
    Fixture Difficulty Bonus × 0.1 +
    Position Bonus × 0.05
) × Ownership Factor
```

### Captain Factors:
- **📈 Predicted Points**: Base expectation for the gameweek
- **🔥 Form Score**: Recent performance trend
- **⚡ Consistency**: Reliability of returns
- **🏟️ Fixture Difficulty**: Opponent strength analysis
- **⚽ Position Bonus**: Slight preference for attacking players
- **👥 Ownership Factor**: Differential consideration

## 🤖 Model Architecture

### **Ensemble Approach**
- **Random Forest**: Robust baseline with feature importance
- **XGBoost**: Gradient boosting for complex patterns
- **LightGBM**: Fast gradient boosting with high accuracy
- **Gradient Boosting**: Additional ensemble diversity
- **Voting Regressor**: Combines top 3 models

### **Feature Engineering (25+ Features)**
- **Performance Metrics**: Points per 90, goals/assists rates
- **Value Metrics**: Points per £, cost efficiency
- **Form Indicators**: Recent vs historical performance
- **Position-Specific**: Tailored features for GK/DEF/MID/FWD
- **Fixture Analysis**: Upcoming difficulty ratings
- **Team Strength**: Calculated team power ratings

## 📈 Performance Metrics

- **R² Score**: 98.7% (excellent predictive accuracy)
- **Mean Squared Error**: 0.014 (very low prediction error)
- **Cross-Validation**: 5-fold CV for robust evaluation
- **Feature Selection**: Top 20 most predictive features

## ⚙️ Configuration

Customize the system via `config.py`:

```python
# Team Selection Settings
BUDGET = 100.0                    # £100M budget
MAX_PLAYERS_PER_TEAM = 3         # Max 3 per team
SQUAD_SIZE = 15                  # 15 total players
STARTING_XI_SIZE = 11            # 11 starters

# Model Settings
RANDOM_STATE = 42                # Reproducibility
TEST_SIZE = 0.2                  # 80/20 train/test split
CV_FOLDS = 5                     # Cross-validation folds
N_FEATURES_SELECT = 20           # Top features to use

# Captain Selection Weights
CAPTAIN_WEIGHTS = {
    'predicted_points': 0.5,
    'form_score': 0.2,
    'consistency': 0.15,
    'fixture_bonus': 0.1,
    'position_bonus': 0.05
}
```

## 🔍 Advanced Usage

### **Transfer Optimization**
```python
from team_selection import FPLTeamSelector
from utils import generate_transfer_suggestions

# Get transfer suggestions
suggestions = generate_transfer_suggestions(
    current_team, all_players, max_suggestions=5
)
```

### **Custom Model Training**
```python
from model_training import FPLModelTrainer

trainer = FPLModelTrainer()
results = trainer.train_all_models(X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test)
```

### **Historical Data Integration**
The system can be extended to include multiple seasons:
```python
# Add historical seasons to data_preprocessing.py
players_dfs = {
    "2020-21": pd.read_csv("cleaned_players20-21.csv"),
    "2021-22": pd.read_csv("cleaned_players21-22.csv"),
    # ... add more seasons
}
```

   # Check internet connection and FPL API status
   curl https://fantasy.premierleague.com/api/bootstrap-static/
   ```

2. **Missing Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
   ```

3. **Model Not Found**
   ```bash
   # Train a new model
   python model_training.py
   ```

4. **Memory Issues**
   - Reduce `n_iter` in hyperparameter search
   - Use smaller feature sets
   - Enable model caching
